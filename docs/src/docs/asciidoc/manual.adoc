This software is licensed under http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html[Apache 2.0] and is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind.

TIP: In order to get an optimal experience I recommend to run DOX on a Linux server such as http://www.ubuntu.com/server[Ubuntu] or some other Linux distribution.
DOX has not been tested on a Windows or a Mac environment but since it has been implemented with Java it will run on these platforms too.

== Support

DOX is hosted a Github. Please report issue to the https://github.com/saw303/dox/issues[project issue tracker].
